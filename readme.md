# laptop setup

```
git clone https://github.com/narkaTee/bootstrap-ws.git
cd bootstrap-ws
./setup-laptop.sh
```

## yubikey

* pam auth with yubikey
  * https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f

Too enable this make sure `inventory/group_vars/laptop.yaml` contains:

```
yubikey_pam_keys:
  - user: <username>
    keylines:
      - "..."
      - "..."
```

each yubikey must be added with a keyline. The line can be obtained by running: `pamu2fcfg -u<username>`

## dracut

drop to shell kernel param: `rd.break=initqueue`

dracut is still experimental in debian.

It requires some manual fixes for plymouth and disk decryption to work (see [`dracut`](dracut/)).

The plan is to use it later with systemd-cryptsetup and fido2 unlock.
But this has to wait until the dracut setup proved to be reliable.
